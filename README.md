### Lessons Learned

This week I knew what the project was going to be by Wednesday.  This helped me with my anxiety and planning for the writing of the code.  I spent the first few days Wednesday and Thursday reading over the project and figuring out what skills I needed and how I was going to plan to accomplish the tasks.  On Friday, Dee went over the project and gave us lots of hints on what we needed to do.  I started working on the project that night.  When homework support hours opened up, I made sure that I took advantage of the opportunity.  When homework hours were finished I continued working in the main room and helping my fellow students who are struggling like I am.  I finished my project on Saturday and submitted it via GitHub.  I am proud of the work I completed this week as I put in a lot of extra work to try and catch up. 

This week went much better than last week.  I spent a lot of time this week out of class going over some topics that I didn't understand the first time around.  I spent an extra few hours a day just watching videos about topics and writing code.

I read that the average new developer writes about 100 lines of code a day.  I wanted to at least match that output, even if all I was doing was writing a for loop over and over again.  I also bought a book on Java called the Java Cookbook by Ian Darwin.  I used it as a reference and also to help boost my confidence in programming.  In addition I bought some books on the OCA test, but I havent really spent much time with them yet.
ll on the quiz but I feel that the material was beyond my abilities at tha
